# Coin Change Problem
> The change-making problem addresses the question of finding the minimum number of coins (of certain denominations) that add up to a given amount of money. It is a special case of the integer knapsack problem, and has applications wider than just currency.

- For example: From three coins 2, 5 and 10, how many ways could we obtain the sum of 25

- Answer: [[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 10], [5, 10, 10], [5, 5, 5, 10], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5]]
